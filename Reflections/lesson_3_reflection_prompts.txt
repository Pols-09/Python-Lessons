Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. Forks allow you to copy another person's repository to yurs directly on github. Cloning allows you to copy a repository onto your computer to work on. This is helpful when making huge changes. Branches refer to a section of a code that allows for changes that don't affect the entire code.
When would you
use one instead of another?

    That's not possible since each have a unique role to play and cannot necessarily be replaced.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

    To help you incase there's a bug in lets say your code at a later time you can easily revert to the last known state to acquire the bug-free version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? It would be exceedingly stressful and would only be possible if your partner is in your vicinity; otherwise there would be a huge delay in completing a task. 
What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in

What benefits does each approach have?
